# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate frontend developer with a focus on creating secure, scalable, and high-performance applications. Recently, I released a new npm package called **[encrypt-storejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/encrypt-storejs)**!

## ðŸ“¦ encrypt-storejs
**encrypt-storejs** is a lightweight JavaScript library designed specifically for securely storing data in the browser's local storage. By leveraging advanced encryption techniques, it ensures that sensitive information remains safe from unauthorized accessâ€”making it ideal for projects where data privacy is a priority.

Give it a try, and feel free to contribute or reach out with any questions!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
