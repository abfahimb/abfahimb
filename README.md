# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

I'm a passionate frontend developer with a focus on creating secure, scalable, and high-performance applications.Exciting news! I've released two npm packages: encrypt-storejs and encrypt-cookiejs!

encrypt-storejs [encrypt-storejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/encrypt-storejs) is a lightweight library that securely stores data in the browser’s local storage using advanced encryption techniques, ensuring your data remains protected.

encrypt-cookiejs [encrypt-cookiejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/encrypt-cookiejs) offers a similar solution for browser cookies, using encryption to securely manage sensitive data stored in cookies, providing enhanced client-side security. Both packages help safeguard your client-side storage with ease!
